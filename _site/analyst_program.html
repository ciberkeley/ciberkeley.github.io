      <h1>We invest in our members</h1>
        Analysts follow a specially designed, semester-long syllabus. Over the course of our education program analysts have the opportunity to learn about diverse investment strategies, fundamental analysis, and financial modeling, enabling them to explore various career paths. In addition to the analyst education program, analysts are also assigned to a client based project each semester, providing them practical experience in professional presentations, portfolio management, and investment research. By the end of the semester analysts will be well equipped to participate in the financial markets in both a professional and personal setting.
        Each analyst will be expected to meet with their team once a week in addition to the assigned meeting time. The time commitment is around 10-15h/week.

      <h1>Meetings</h1>
        Club members will meet weekly for one and a half hour on Thursday evenings (6:30-8:00PM) to discuss up-to-date market events and learn about different finance related topics including but not limited to: equity, fixed income, derivatives, portfolio theory, FinTech, etc. We will also be hosting multiple guest speakers throughout the course of the semester. 

        We will also be hosting educational workshops on weekends to educate analysts on complementary subjects and career workshops to ensure all members are ready for the upcoming recruitment season.

        CIB also hosts multiple campus events. In Spring 2016, we have hosted the Farallon Third Annual Undergraduate Investment Case Competition. We have also partnered with the Career Fair to host the Internship & Summer Job Fair.

      <h1>Teams</h1>
        At CIB, we aim to explore all dimensions of the financial world. We have chosen Portfolio Management, Equity Research and Software Development to be the three pillars of our organization, and naturally assigned teams with research projects falling into one of these three divisions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Software Development</h2>
        The Software Development team explores various machine learning techniques to find insights within financial markets. More importantly, our goal is to provide analysts with experience in a field that lies at the intersection between data science and finance. While analysts that choose to go with the software development team typically possess a background in computer science, engineering or mathematics, we welcome any student with interest for computer aided trading systems.
        Past projects include sentiment analysis for financial articles and the application of modern techniques such as deep learning and tree boosting to forecast volatility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Equity Research</h2>
        The Equity Research team is responsible for the write up of a bi-weekly journal delivered to sponsors and investors containing micro and macro market analysis. We take a top-down approach as we start off by analyzing a specific industry and the different trends and then narrow our search down to a few public companies. 

        The goal of the Equity Research Team is to give analysts the tools to successfully start off their career in finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Portfolio Management</h2>
        The Portfolio Management team is a smaller team composed of the most advanced analysts responsible for evaluating multi-asset diversification strategies and risk management of portfolio analytics. Portfolio Managers will be in charge of leading the market discussions for the club and advising the Executive Team on the management of the prospective portfolio.

      <h1>Lectures</h1>
      Weekly lectures provide our members with the strongest background in finance. This is where programmers discover portfolio management strategies and stock pickers get to learn about machine learning. This syllabus was designed by our experienced leadership and will be taught over interactive presentations. Analysts will find here the lecture slides whenever they feel the need to review a concept.
