        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
          The purpose of the competition is to advance understanding of public equity investing using real companies and current industry dynamics.  Students at Wharton – University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale and University of California, Berkeley interested in a career in public market investing should find this case study exercise rewarding. 
      </p>
      <p>
          A select group of top Farallon investment professionals will serve as judges and provide feedback to all participating teams.  One finalist team will be chosen from each school and awarded a roundtrip visit to Farallon’s headquarters in San Francisco to present their case work.  An overall winner will be selected and the day will conclude with a light reception in our offices.
      </p>
      <p>

        <h2>CASE STUDY</h2>

          Teams of 3-4 students should select a public company they believe has the greatest potential for price appreciation over the next three-to-five years.  
      </p>
      <p>
          Please note that the company must 1) be listed on an American exchange, and 2) have a market capitalization of at least US$1 billion.  Successful analysis should provide insight to the team’s view of the company’s value versus its publicly traded value.
